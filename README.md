# ðŸ’» Project

##### This project was made with the intention of practicing with my knowledge about the use of Nextjs. You can filter which anime you want to search and, thus, it will request an api (https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/anime) that will list the animes related to the written name.
##### Clicking on an anime dynamically loads a page with the anime's information.
